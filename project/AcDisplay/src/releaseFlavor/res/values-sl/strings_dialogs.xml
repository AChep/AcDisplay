        Hello,<br/>
        First of all I want to thank you for the amount of downloads and high ratings on Play Store.
        Huge progress has been made in AcDisplay and a this could not have been done without the community. That is why AcDisplay is <a href="https://www.github.com/AChep/AcDisplay">open</a> for everyone. But I need some help from you.<br/>
        This is my last school year and I would like to buy a notebook for future studies and to bring the world awesome software wherever I may be.
        I would highly appreciate your help with it.
