    How to dismiss the permanent notifications of active mode or the lockscreen?
</b><br/>
This notification is necessary to ensure the AcDisplay process isn't automatically stopped by Android. To hide it, <a
        href="acdisplay://launch_app_info">launch the App Info</a> and disable showing notifications. NOTE: Sending test notifications will not function while this is disabled.

    How do I use the blacklist?
</b><br/>
To use the blacklist, you must enable and configure the app.
To enable, launch the application and press the "Switch" button so "On" is displayed.
To enable an application on the Black List, select the application and then press the "Switch" button so "On" is displayed. Optionally you can "Hide" the applications notifications and "Silent" the notification so the screen will not wake up.
